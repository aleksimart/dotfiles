# dotfiles

All the important dotfiles of my system

## TODO

- [x] Configure **_quickscope_**
- [ ] Configure **_floaterm_**
- [ ] Change from **_rainbow parentheses_** to **_rainbow_**
- [x] Add java syntax
- [ ] Learn more about coc-action
- [ ] Add kitty config to dotfiles
- [ ] Add fira code installation to _install.sh_

## BUGS TO FIX

- [ ] Java syntax doesn't work
- [ ] i3 syntax only works if I open the file right away
- [x] ~~JSON forces having literally no space~~ (coc-prettier did the job)
